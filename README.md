# randomlist-shiny
A Basic Shiny app used as an icebreaker activity during a meeting hosted remotely on Zoom. This app randomly chooses a question for participants to answer. It then asks participants to share their Glows and grows while working on a project. Finally, the user has to introduce a number to pick the next person to participate.
